# Worldlang Dict

An open source translation dictionary designed for worldlangs, written in PHP.

Originally designed for the Globasa IAL wordlang, this dictionary
serves translation pages for each entry from a YAML file as well as some
other dictionary functions.

It's design to have a single worldang language. The data is based around that language's
word list. There may not be homonyms, and there are multiple translation senses for
each entry in natlangs (eg. English).

The interface and the world list are designed to have multiple language
translations to be useful to anyone wanting to use it as a translation
dictionary. Worldlang Dictionary is designed for a constructed language (conlang)
designed to operate as an international auxiliary language (auxlang /
worldlang). However, it have very limited translations for the interface so far.

## Installation

You should be able to simply copy the root files anywhere on a file server. It
requires PHP 8 and YAML support. The .htaccess
handles routing for fancy URIs. both `/index.php` and `/update.php` should
__not__ be writable by group.

Copy the `config.php.defaul` to `config.php` and edit the file.

It's currently set to auto-update the CSV if you setup a cron job for it.

It requires an API which is generated by https://github.com/Globasa-Team/globasa-api
and is documented at https://github.com/Globasa-Team/globasa-docs
